This is one of the most underrated features of the web.',A,g,Z=`But this poses a question when running Javascript. If the page has not fully loaded by the time our code runs, how does a selector like <code>document.getElementById</code> behave? Well, it only gets run on the part that has already been loaded.
This is dangerous when trying to hydrate a page, since the elements your code is trying to hydrate might not be there yet. To avoid this, pretty much all sites run their JS <em>after</em> the HTML has been fully recieved and parsed. We used to do this with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/DOMContentLoaded_event" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>DOMContentLoaded</code></a> or by putting our scripts at the bottom of the page, but today we usually use <code>defered</code>, or <code>type=module</code> on the script tag to achieve this.`,I,k,$="There is also the additional problem that non-deferred scripts are render-blocking, meaning that the browser will not render anything that comes after them until they have finished running.

In order to decide which theme we should display, we need to check some sort local persistence. That might be <code>localStorage</code>, <code>IndexedDB</code> or a plain old <code>cookie</code>. Either way, JS needs to run. If our JS runs <em>after</em> the page has been fully parsed, as is the default nowadays, we get a flash of the default theme.
